_This is an excerpt of [a post][original] that I wrote for [Olio Apps][]._

I wrote [git-format-staged][] to apply an automatic code formatter or linter to
staged files. It ignores unstaged changes, and leaves those changes unstaged.
When run in a Git pre-commit hook git-format-staged guarantees that committed
files are formatted properly, and does not clobber unstaged changes if
formatting cannot be applied to working tree files cleanly.

## How I learned to love automatic formatting

I used to pay a lot of attention to code formatting. I would split or join
lines, indent to just the right column, and so on. Then I learned about
[Prettier][], and tried it out in my Javascript projects. After setting up an
editor plugin I could tap a key combination, and Prettier would do the same
things that I was doing by hand in an instant without any thought on my part.
The code did not wind up in exactly the style that I was used to - but it was
formatted according to a set of consistent, sensible rules that I can live with.
I realized that if I can trust a program to format my code nicely I can free up
a not-insubstantial chunk of my attention. That leaves me with more mental
capacity to devote to matters that actually require human input. I have not
looked back!
