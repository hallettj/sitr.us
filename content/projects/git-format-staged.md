A git add-on that formats staged changes to code files
using an automatic formatter like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/),
and works seamlessly with partially-staged files.
There are other tools that do the same job;
but git-format-staged takes a unique, and in my opinion elegant, approach.

For background on this project, and for some background on git's internal
workings, see my post, [Autmotic Code Formatting for Partially-Staged
Files](@/2018-08-16_automatic-code-formatting/index.md).
