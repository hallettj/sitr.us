This is the project I work on in my day job. Hasura puts an automatic
GraphQL API in front of your database to speed up development. The MongoDB
Connector is the code that makes Hasura work with MongoDB specifically.

In my opinion this project showcases some good Rust code, and some Nix
automation that I am especially proud of.
