_This is an excerpt of [a post][original] that I wrote for my employer, [Originate][]._

One of our recent projects called for a feature to allow editors to manage and
publish content. In other words, we needed a CMS.  We already had a React-based
web app, and a React Native mobile app in the works where we wanted to present
that content. So we needed a Headless CMS. Unlike Wordpress or other traditional
CMS solutions, a headless CMS does not come with a web interface where readers
will see published content. Instead, a headless system acts more like
a database: it hosts content, and your app uses an API to fetch content to
display. As a result, your choice of app architecture is not tied to your choice
of CMS. This can be especially helpful if you want to incorporate managed
content into an app that is not primarily a publishing platform, or if you want
to present the same content differently in different contexts as was the case
with our web vs mobile apps.

One of the biggest challenges with headless CMS systems is choosing one. The
field is wide open, and headless systems have not been around long enough for
a clear leader to stand out.
